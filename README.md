Demo project django ecommerce (part 1)


This project was done while I was learning with the #justDjango ecommerce project course(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4USlooVXG0&list=PLLRM7ROnmA9F2vBXypzzplFjcHUaKWWP5&ab_channel=JustDjango).
Only the paying card save part is missing (the last part of the tutorial). For this project I also spent
a lot of time on the stackoverflow a.o. Enjoy!
